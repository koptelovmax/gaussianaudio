## Gaussian Process Audio Model for audio texture modeling and synthesis
This is a repository for Audio Processing and Indexing cource project of Leiden university:
http://liacs.leidenuniv.nl/~bakkerem2/api/

### Repository content:
- GPAM-FD.ipynb - Gaussian Process Audio Model in frequency domain (instructions are included in the Python file, open it with Jupyter)
- GPAM-TD.ipynb - Gaussian Process Audio Model in time domain (does not work properly)
- piano.wav - sample used for experiments
- /Examples - examples of successful synthesis

### Used in this project:
Jupyter notebook:
http://jupyter.org/install.html

Python library for audio processing:
